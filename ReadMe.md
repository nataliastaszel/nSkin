# HOW TO RUN?

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have installed the latest version of git and Docker on your operating system and also .NET SDK (optional): If you want to run the application without Docker for debugging purposes.

### 2. Clone the Repository
Clone your project repository to your local machine:
```bash
  git clone git@github.com:nataliastaszel/nSkin.git
````

### 3. Build the Docker Images

Navigate to the folder containing the `compose.yml` file and build the image:

```bash
  docker compose build
```

### 4. Start the Services

Run the application using Docker Compose:

```bash
  docker compose up
```

### 5. Access the Application

After the services start, open your browser and navigate to:

Application: http://localhost:8080

### 6. Stop the Application

To stop the application, press Ctrl + C in the terminal where docker-compose up is running. Alternatively, stop the containers using:

```bash
    docker compose down
```

### 7. Troubleshooting

##### Container Permissions

If you encounter issues with permissions for wwwroot (e.g., saving product images), ensure the necessary folders exist and have proper permissions on your host system:

```bash
  mkdir -p ./nSkinShop/wwwroot/images/product
  chmod -R 777 ./nSkinShop/wwwroot
```

##### Rebuild Docker Images

If changes are not reflected after modifying the code, rebuild the containers:

```bash
  docker compose down --volumes
  docker compose up --build
```

##### Database Connection Issues

Ensure the nskinshop-db service in the `compose.yml` is healthy before starting the application. Use the following command to check the logs:

```bash
  docker compose logs nskinshop-db
```

# DATABASE CONNECTION

Connection to a database set in the appsettings.json.


### "DefaultConnection": 

"Host=nskinshop-db;Port=5432;Database=nSkinShop;Username=SA;Password=MyStrongPass123;TrustServerCertificate=True"
